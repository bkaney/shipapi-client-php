ShipAPI Client for PHP5
-----------------------

The library is a simple to use interface to the services provided
by http://www.shipapi.com ShipAPI.


REQUIREMENTS:

 * php5
 * php_openssl.dll


SYNOPSIS:

To use ShipAPI, you can set the class constant ShipAPI::URI, then 
require the class.

   ShipApi::URI = 'https://live.shipapi.com';
   require_once("ShipApi.php");

First, you create a new ShipApi object, passing in the username and
apiKey.

   $shipApi = new ShipApi("username", "1234567890abcdefg");

Then you can make requests to the ShipApi service.  Please refer to
the http://www.shipapi.com/api API-Guide for more information.

Here are a few examples:

   # This will do a HTTP GET for /shipments
   $return = $shipApi->get('/shipments');

   # This will do a HTTP POST for /shipments/15/packages
   $return = $shipApi->post('/shipments/15/packages', $packageData);

   # This will do a HTTP DELETE for /shipments/15/packages/1
   $return = $shipApi->delete('/shipments/packages/1');

   # This will do an HTTP PUT for /users/1981
   $return = $shipApi->put('/users/1981', $userUpdateData);

The return for these methods is a ShipApi_Resonse object.  This object
will contain the HTTP resonse, as well as the body (both in XML form, 
as well as serialized as a PHP array/hash).

   $return->http;  # HTTP object
   $return->xml;   # The XML as a string
   $return->data;  # The XML serialized as PHP named array
