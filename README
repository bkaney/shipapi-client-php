ShipAPI Client for PHP5
-----------------------

The library is a simple to use interface to the services provided
by http://www.shipapi.com ShipAPI.


REQUIREMENTS:

  * php5
  * php_openssl.dll


SYNOPSIS:

First, you create a new ShipApi object, passing in the username and
apiKey and the ShipAPI URI.

   require_once("ShipApi.php");
   $shipApi = new ShipApi("username", "1234567890abcdefg", "https://live.shipapi.com");

Then you can make requests to the ShipApi service.  Please refer to
the http://www.shipapi.com/api API-Guide for more information.

Here are a few examples:

   # This will do a HTTP GET for /shipments
   $return = $shipApi->get('/shipments');

   # This will do a HTTP POST for /shipments/15/packages
   $return = $shipApi->post('/shipments/15/packages', $packageData);

   # This will do a HTTP DELETE for /shipments/15/packages/1
   $return = $shipApi->delete('/shipments/packages/1');

   # This will do an HTTP PUT for /users/1981
   $return = $shipApi->put('/users/1981', $userUpdateData);

The return for these methods is a Zend_Rest_Client_Response object.

   $return->isSuccess();            # If it was a success
   $return->result;                 # The result
   $return->result->id();           # The id property
   $return->result->company();      # The company property
